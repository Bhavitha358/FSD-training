OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
--> objects
--> classes
--> variables
--> methods
Constructors :
1) default constructors 
2) parameterized constructors
If we didn't initialize any variable in the method, then by default these are assigned with values as follows:
  string--> null
  int --> 0
  boolean --> false
Access specifiers :
  public
  private
--> By creating methods in the class we can access private members of the class.
 Keywords :
-->This: refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access variable that belong to the class.
   * also used when the attributes and data members share the same name.
--> Final: is used to fix the value of the variable, properties or methods.
  * If any variable is declared as a final so you can't set the value or modify the value later.
 -->static : if a method or variable is given as static, then that method or variable belongs to entire class.
