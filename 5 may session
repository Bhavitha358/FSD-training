Java


Why Java?
History of Java
Features of Java:
--> Java is a simpler programming language , it doesn't contain any complex such as pointers 
      Disadvantages Of Pointers:
          Pointers are ambiguous
          Improper use of pointers can crash the code
--> Java is an object oriented programming language.
Question: Is java a purely object-oriented language?
Ans : Yes, Java is an object oriented programming language but it is not purely object oriented. To say a language to be a purely object oriented language, it must contain 
only classes and objects , and must not contain PRIMITIVE datatypes. But java contains both primitive datatypes and also objects and classes. So java is not a purely 
object oriented language.
